This is an MVP of a lightweight HTML build to display my NFTs in a gallery type environment.

I thought it would be interesting to build using Github Pages, since this solution is meant to 
be lightweight and quickly updatable.

The structure ends up looking like this:
- Update iownthese respository grid with photo link
- Create new repository named after NFT
